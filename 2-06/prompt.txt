Thinking step-by-step I need to find a solution for out new project - Social platform with millions of users. I need to decide what database to use for the implementation, taking into account the following requirements:

- It needs to store profiles, posts, and connections between users
- It is required to have high data read speed
- It is expected to have 80% read operations and 20% write operations
- It need to support easy scalability, as we expect fast user base growth

I need to make the best possible unformatted decision
